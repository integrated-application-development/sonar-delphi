[SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org) is an open platform to manage code quality. This plugin adds
Delphi support to
SonarQube.

The project was originally a [Sabre Airline Solutions](https://www.sabre.com) donation, and has been
iterated on by
various open-source maintainers in the intervening years. In 2018, it was revived as a Monash
University student
project for [IntegraDev](https://www.integradev.com.au).

Since 2019, the project has been maintained by IntegraDev.

Features
-------

* 100+ rules
* Metrics (complexity, number of lines, etc.)
* Import of test coverage reports (compatible
  with [Delphi Code Coverage](https://github.com/DelphiCodeCoverage/DelphiCodeCoverage))
* Custom rules

Quickstart
----------

Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - [SonarQube](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/install-server/) (v9.9+)
    - [SonarScanner](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/analyzing-source-code/scanners/sonarscanner/)
    - [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)

2. **Install Plugin:**
    - Download the SonarDelphi plugin
      from [Releases](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/sonar-delphi/releases).
    - [Install the plugin](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/install-plugin/).

3. **Configure Analysis:**
    - Configure [language-specific properties](#language-specific-properties).

4. **Run Analysis:**
    - Execute `sonar-scanner` in your project's directory.

5. **View Results:**
    - Visit the link provided at the end of the scan to view analysis results on SonarQube.

> :warning: **Note**
>
> The SonarDelphi analyzer requires source code for all dependencies, including the standard
> library.
>
> As a result, Delphi CE is not supported.

## Language-specific properties

You can discover and update the
Delphi-specific [properties](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/analyzing-source-code/analysis-parameters/)
in: **Administration > General Settings > Languages > Delphi**

By default, all `__history` and `__recovery` directories are excluded from the analysis.
However, you can change the property `sonar.delphi.exclusions` to a different pattern if you want to
force their analysis (not recommended).
