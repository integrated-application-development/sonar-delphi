SonarDelphi is a modern, performant, and fully-featured community code analyzer for the Delphi language. As
a plugin for the [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org) code analysis platform, it can be easily integrated
into existing workflows.

This project has four primary goals:

* **Correctness:** All valid Delphi code should be accepted and understood correctly.
* **Utility:** Analysis results should be easily understandable and immediately actionable.
* **Extensibility:** New rules should be trivial to add and have access to the full power of the analyzer.

This project aims to follow the conventions and best practices of SonarQube's official analyzers. It is actively
maintained by a core team and is [open for community contributions](#contributing).

## Features

With SonarDelphi, you can:

* Analyse Delphi code, identifying issues from more than 120 rules
* Enable, disable, or configure rules using a variety of parameters
* Create custom rules in the SonarQube UI from templates
* Import [NUnit](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/technical-notes/usage/Test-Result-XML-Format.html) test reports (compatible with [DUnitX](https://github.com/VSoftTechnologies/DUnitX))
* Import test coverage reports (compatible with [DelphiCodeCoverage](https://github.com/DelphiCodeCoverage/DelphiCodeCoverage))

Advanced features unique to this version of SonarDelphi include:

* **Semantic analysis:** SonarDelphi understands what your code *means*, paving the way for powerful rules such as:
   * [Variables must be initialized before being used](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/VariableInitializationCheck.java)
   * [Name casing should be kept consistent](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/MixedNamesCheck.java)
   * [FreeAndNil must only be passed an instance of a TObject descendant](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/FreeAndNilTObjectCheck.java)
   * [Overriding methods should do more than simply call the same method in the super class](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/InheritedMethodWithNoCodeCheck.java)
   * [Constructors should not be invoked on object variables](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/InstanceInvokedConstructorCheck.java)
   * [The Single overloads of the standard math functions should not be used](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/MathFunctionSingleOverloadCheck.java)
   * [Redundant casts should not be used](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/RedundantCastCheck.java)
   * [Platform-dependent casts should not be used](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/PlatformDependentCastCheck.java)
   * [Character types should not be cast to Character Pointer types](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/CharacterToCharacterPointerCastCheck.java)
   * [Unicode types should not be cast to ANSI types](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/UnicodeToAnsiCastCheck.java)
   * Your own custom rules to [enforce a naming convention for descendants of specific types](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/InheritedTypeNameCheck.java)
   * Your own custom rules to forbid usage of specific
     [types](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/ForbiddenTypeCheck.java),
     [methods](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/ForbiddenMethodCheck.java),
     [properties](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/ForbiddenPropertyCheck.java),
     [identifiers](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/ForbiddenIdentifierCheck.java),
     [constants](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/ForbiddenConstantCheck.java),
     [enum values](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/ForbiddenEnumValueCheck.java), or
     [units](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/ForbiddenImportFilePatternCheck.java)
* **Dead code analysis:** Using semantic analysis, SonarDelphi is capable of identifying unused code in
   your project, including:
   * [Unused imports](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/UnusedImportCheck.java)
   * [Unused types](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/UnusedTypeCheck.java)
   * [Unused methods](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/UnusedMethodCheck.java)
   * [Unused properties](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/UnusedPropertyCheck.java)
   * [Unused fields](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/UnusedFieldCheck.java)
   * [Unused local variables](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/UnusedLocalVariableCheck.java)
   * [Unused constants](delphi-checks/src/main/java/au/com/integradev/delphi/checks/UnusedConstantCheck.java)
* **Support for additional rule plugins:** If the custom rules bundled in this plugin are insufficient for your
   customisation needs, SonarDelphi supports additional rule plugins, allowing you to define new rules using
   the same API as the core plugin. For more details, refer to the
   [Custom Rules 101](docs/CUSTOM_RULES_101.md).
**Custom rules:** SonarDelphi is easily customized through rule parameters and template rules, but for more advanced
   functionality you can also create your own custom rules:
* Exposes a Java-based rules API with the full power of the SonarDelphi analysis engine.
* For more details, refer to [Custom Rules 101](docs/CUSTOM_RULES_101.md).

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> Unfortunately, Delphi Community Edition is **not** supported. SonarDelphi requires source code for all dependencies,
> including the standard library.

1. Install the following:
    - [SonarQube](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/install-server/) (v9.9+)
    - [SonarScanner](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/analyzing-source-code/scanners/sonarscanner/)
    - [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)

2. Install the plugin:
    1. Download the SonarDelphi plugin
      from [Releases](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/sonar-delphi/releases).
    2. [Install the plugin](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/install-plugin/) on the SonarQube server.

3. Run analysis on your Delphi project:
    - [Configure](#advanced-configuration) your `sonar.delphi.installationPath`.
    - Execute `sonar-scanner` in your project's directory.

4. View analysis results:
    - Visit the link provided at the end of the scan to view analysis results on SonarQube.

### Advanced configuration

You can configure SonarDelphi [analysis parameters](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/analyzing-source-code/analysis-parameters/)
 on the SonarQube server at **Administration > General Settings > Languages > Delphi**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `sonar.delphi.installationPath` must point to a valid Delphi installation for the scan to succeed.

For the full list of SonarDelphi properties, [see here](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Contributing

SonarDelphi is open for contributions, from bug reports to new features. For more details, please read the
[contributing guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development

SonarDelphi can be built with JDK 17+ using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

The project targets Java 11, which is
[required](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/9.9/requirements/prerequisites-and-overview/#java)
for compatibility with SonarQube 9.9.

To build the project and run all tests, execute the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

After building, the plugin jar can be found in `sonar-delphi-plugin/target`.

## History

SonarDelphi was originally released by [Sabre Airline Solutions](https://www.sabre.com) in 2012, and has been iterated
on by various open-source maintainers over the years.

In 2018, it was picked up as a Monash University student project for [IntegraDev](https://www.integradev.com.au).
Since 2019, the project has been actively developed by IntegraDev.
