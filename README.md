[SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org) is an open platform to manage code quality. This plugin adds Delphi support to
SonarQube.

The project was originally a [Sabre Airline Solutions](https://www.sabre.com) donation, and has been iterated on by
various open-source maintainers in the intervening years. In 2018, it was revived as a Monash University student
project for [IntegraDev](https://www.integradev.com.au).

Since 2019, the plugin has been maintained by IntegraDev.
