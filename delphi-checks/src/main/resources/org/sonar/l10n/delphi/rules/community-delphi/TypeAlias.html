<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Type aliases simply provide another name for a type. While they can be helpful for shortening
  long names, disambiguating name collisions, and writing cross-platform code, when misused they
  can make code significantly more difficult to understand.
</p>
<p>
  Type aliases should only be introduced where it is practical and unambiguous to do so.
