<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Visibility specifier directives (<code>private</code>, <code>public</code>, etc.) should use the
  same indentation as the type name that they are declared under. This allows developers to easily
  differentiate between fields, methods, and properties of different visibilities.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that this rule checks for an exact match on trailing whitespace - mixed indentation
  may yield unexpected results.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Indent the visibility specifier at the same level as the enclosing type declaration:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
  type
    TFoo = class(TObject)
      private
      procedure Bar;
      public
      public constructor Create;
    end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
  type
    TFoo = class(TObject)
    private
      procedure Bar;
    public
      constructor Create;
    end;
</pre>
