<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Code that follows a consistent naming convention is self-documenting. In Delphi, all unit names
  should be in PascalCase and may be prefixed with a consistent prefix.
</p>
<p>
  There is no default prefix, but some projects may use a prefix to separate their units from those
  of other projects. This can make code spanning several projects more easily understandable.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Rename the unit name to follow the convention.</p>
