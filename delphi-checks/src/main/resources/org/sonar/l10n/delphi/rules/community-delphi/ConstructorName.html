<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Code that follows a consistent naming convention is self-documenting. In Delphi, all constructor
  names should be in PascalCase and start with the word "Create".
</p>
<p>
  Using a consistent naming convention makes constructor calls visually distinct, making it
  clear when an object is allocated.
  This helps in easy diagnosis of memory bugs by reducing the chance of misreading
  a constructor as a non-allocating operation (e.g. a class procedure).
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Rename the constructor name to follow the convention.</p>
