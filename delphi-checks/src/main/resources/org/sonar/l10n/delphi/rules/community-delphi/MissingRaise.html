<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  When writing an exception raise in Delphi, a common mistake is to omit the <code>raise</code>,
  causing the exception to be created but not actually used. This is bad for a number of reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The exception object is never freed, causing a memory leak.</li>
  <li>Control flow continues as usual, even though an undesired exceptional state has been reached.</li>
  <li>The bug is easy to miss but can greatly alter the path of execution.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Add the <code>raise</code> keyword. If the exception is not required, delete the constructor invocation instead.</p>
