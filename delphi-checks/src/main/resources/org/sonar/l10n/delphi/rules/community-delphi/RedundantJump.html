<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Unnecessarily annotating the default control flow of a program using statements such as
  <code>Continue</code>, <code>Break</code>, and <code>Exit</code> makes the code harder to read and
  understand. Although these statements appear to alter the flow of a program, the control flow is
  identical without it.

<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the redundant jump:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure Example;
begin
  while Condition do begin
    // ...
    Continue; // Noncompliant
  end;
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure Example;
begin
  while Condition do begin
    // ...
  end;
end;
</pre>
