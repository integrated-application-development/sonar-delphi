<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Having unused routines adversely affects code readability, as their presence is confusing. Code
  that is never used should be removed to keep codebases clean and maintainable.
</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Methods annotated with attributes, as these are often accessed via reflection.</li>
  <li>Methods with <code>published</code> visibility, as these are often accessed via reflection or
    used by the Delphi IDE for design-time configuration.</li>
  <li>Methods marked <code>override</code>.</li>
  <li>Methods implementing an interface.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the unused method.</p>
