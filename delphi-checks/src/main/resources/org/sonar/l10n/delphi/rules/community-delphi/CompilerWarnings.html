<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  The Delphi compiler issues warning messages when detecting certain issues, such as uninitialized
  variables, mission function results, construction of abstract objects, and so on. These warnings
  provide important feedback on possible bugs and should not be disabled.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the compiler directive disabling the warning(s).</p>
