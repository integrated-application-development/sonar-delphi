<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Having consecutive <code>type</code> sections is useless and negatively impacts readability.
  Combining the sections into one larger section is more concise and easier to understand.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Combine the <code>type</code> sections together:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
type
  TFoo = class(TObject)
    // ...
  end;

type
  TBar = string;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
type
  TFoo = class(TObject)
    // ...
  end;

  TBar = string;
</pre>
