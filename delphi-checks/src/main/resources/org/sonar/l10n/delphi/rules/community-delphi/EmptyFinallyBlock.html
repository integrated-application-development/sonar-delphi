<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Empty finally blocks are superfluous. The purpose of a finally block is to be executed
  regardless of whether an exception was raised within the try block, so an empty finally
  block has no effect.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>If there should be something in the finally block, add it:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
try
  DoSomething;
finally
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
try
  DoSomething;
finally
  Writeln('All done!');
end;
</pre>
<p>If not, the try/finally statement can be removed:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
try
  DoSomething;
finally
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="compliant">
DoSomething;
</pre>
