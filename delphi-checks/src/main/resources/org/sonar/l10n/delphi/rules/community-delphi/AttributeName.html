<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Code that follows a consistent naming convention is self-documenting. In Delphi, all custom
  attribute class names should be in PascalCase and end with <code>Attribute</code>. No prefix
  is required.
</p>
<p>
  Custom attributes suffixed with <code>Attribute</code> may have the suffix omitted when
  used. This means that attributes can be defined with the same name (e.g. <code>MyCustom</code>
  and <code>MyCustomAttribute</code>), which may cause unexpected behaviour.
</p>
<p>
  To safeguard against this, the <code>Attribute</code> suffix should be used consistently.
  The suffix is also recommended for clarity, as attribute classes should not be used in other ways
  or instantiated directly.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Rename the attribute class name to follow the convention.</p>
