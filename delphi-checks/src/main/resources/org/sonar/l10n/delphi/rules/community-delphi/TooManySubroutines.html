<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Methods with many subroutines make for code that is difficult to navigate and understand.
  While nested methods can be helpful for small units of work specific to a particular method,
  their easily missed syntax and non-linear control flow make them confusing when containing large
  amounts of functionality.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Consider if the subroutines can be inlined to the body of the main method:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure DoThing;
  procedure DoSubThing;
  begin
    Log('Hello!');
  end;
  // ...
begin
  DoSubThing;
  // ...
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure DoThing;
begin
  Log('Hello');
  // ...
end;
</pre>
<p>Otherwise, extract the subroutines out into one or more independent methods:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure DoThing;
  procedure DoSubThing;
  begin
    // ...
  end;
  // ...
begin
  // ...
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure DoSubThing;
begin
  // ...
end;

procedure DoThing;
begin
  // ...
end;
</pre>
