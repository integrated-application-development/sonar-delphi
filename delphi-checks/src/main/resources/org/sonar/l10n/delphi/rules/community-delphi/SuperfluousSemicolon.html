<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Delphi allows empty statements, which means that stray semicolons can be added in most places.
  These are unnecessary, confusing, and should be removed.
</p>
<p>They are almost always introduced by mistake, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Forgetting to add an actual statement</li>
  <li>Making a typo by doubling an existing semicolon</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the stray semicolon:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
Result := 123;;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
Result := 123;
</pre>
