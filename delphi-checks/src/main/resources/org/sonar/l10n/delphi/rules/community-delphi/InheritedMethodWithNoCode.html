<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  An overridden method containing only an inherited statement without any other
  actions is superfluous. The presence of the overridden method is also misleading, as it
  implies that the behaviour has been changed from the base class.

<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the method override.</p>
