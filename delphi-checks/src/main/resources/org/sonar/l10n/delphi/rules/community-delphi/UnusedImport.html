<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Having unused imports adversely affects code readability, as their presence is confusing. Code
  that is never used should be removed to keep codebases clean and maintainable. Unused imports may
  also negatively affect compilation time and impact the ability of the compiler to perform accurate
  incremental compilation.
</p>
<p>
  Note that there are cases where importing "unused" units is necessary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Units with an initialization section, finalization section, or a <code>Register</code> procedure
    need to be imported at least once for code in those locations to be executed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Units that are used in the Delphi form file need to be included in the source file's uses
    clause.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the unused import.</p>
