<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of how many paths there are through a stretch of code.
  The cyclomatic complexity of routines should not be excessive, as complex code will be difficult
  to understand and maintain.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>
  Refactor this routine so it runs more linearly, for example by reducing the number of times
  the control flow splits.
