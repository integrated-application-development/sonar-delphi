<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Having unused property adversely affects code readability, as their presence is confusing. Code
  that is never used should be removed to keep codebases clean and maintainable.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this rule excludes unused published properties, as these are often accessed via
  reflection or used by the Delphi IDE for design-time configuration.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the unused property.</p>
