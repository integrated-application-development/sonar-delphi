<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Having consecutive <code>const</code> sections is useless and negatively impacts readability.
  Combining the sections into one larger section is more concise and easier to understand.
</p>
<p>
  This rule also picks up consecutive <code>resourcestring</code> sections.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Combine the <code>const</code> or <code>resourcestring</code> sections together:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
const
  CFoo = 5;
  CBar = 'abc';
const
  CBaz = 24.4;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
const
  CFoo = 5;
  CBar = 'abc';
  CBaz = 24.4;
</pre>
