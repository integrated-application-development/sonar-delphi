<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Code that follows a consistent naming convention is self-documenting. In Delphi, all pointer names
  should be named identically to the dereferenced type, with the type prefix swapped for <code>P</code>.
</p>
<p>
  For example, the pointer types for <code>TMyType</code>, 
  <code>EMyType</code>, and <code>IMyType</code> should be named <code>PMyType</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Custom prefixes for dereferenced types are also supported, 
  provided they also start with <code>T</code>, <code>E</code> or <code>I</code>.
</p>
<p>
  For example, the pointer types for <code>TxyMyType</code>, 
  <code>ExyMyType</code>, and <code>IxyMyType</code> should be named <code>PxyMyType</code>.
</p>
<p>
  If dereferenced type is in PascalCase but does not have a valid prefix, 
  the pointer name is expected to be the same as the type name but with the addition of the prefix <code>P</code>.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>^MyObject</code> should be named <code>PMyObject</code></li>
  <li><code>^MyType</code> should be named <code>PMyType</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that pointers to types that do not follow the naming standard are valid 
  as long as they are in PascalCase with the prefix <code>P</code>.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>^my_object</code> will be valid if named <code>PMyObject</code></li>
  <li><code>^my_object</code> will not be valid if named <code>Pmy_object</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Rename the pointer type to follow the convention.</p>
