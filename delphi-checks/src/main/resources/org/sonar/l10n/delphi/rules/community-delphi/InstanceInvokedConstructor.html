<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Delphi constructors should only be called on the class. A common error for new Delphi programmers
  is to call a constructor on an instance variable instead. This does not create a new instance of
  the object, instead being treated as a regular method invocation.
</p>
<p>
  If the instance has already been initialized, it will unexpectedly modify it by re-running the
  constructor.
</p>
<p>
  If the instance is uninitialized, an access violation may occur (the constructor will attempt
  to set fields on uninitialized memory).
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Call the constructor on the class instead:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure Example;
var
  Foo: TFoo;
begin
  Foo.Create;
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure Example;
var
  Foo: TFoo;
begin
  Foo := TFoo.Create;
end;
</pre>
