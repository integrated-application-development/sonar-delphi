<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Omitting the corresponding <code>.fmx</code> resource for a FireMonkey form or frame is typically
  a programming error. While there are some cases that won't cause problems at runtime, it remains
  unintuitive and confusing.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, a unit that doesn't contain a <code>.fmx</code> resource will lack design-time form
  editing functionality.
</p>
<p>
  This rule flags any <code>TForm</code> or <code>TFrame</code> descendant in a unit that doesn't
  include a <code>.fmx</code> resource.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Add a <code>.fmx</code> resource to the unit:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
unit Foo;

interface

uses
  FMX.Forms;

type
  TFoo = class(TForm)
    // ...
  end;

implementation

end.
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
unit Foo;

interface

uses
  FMX.Forms;

type
  TFoo = class(TForm)
    // ...
  end;

implementation

{$R *.fmx}

end.
</pre>
