<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  It is possible to use a bare <code>inherited</code> in any method implementation, even if there is
  no base method to call. Although this statement has no behavioral effect, it is misleading and
  indicates a possible programming mistake.
</p>
<p>
  Since the <code>inherited</code> keyword works regardless of whether the method is marked as
  <code>override</code>, it can also lead to unexpected behavioral change if corresponding ancestor
  methods are added later.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the <code>inherited</code> statement:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure TChild.Proc(Foo: TFoo);
begin
  inherited;
  // ...
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure TChild.Proc(Foo: TFoo);
begin
  // ...
end;
</pre>
