<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Having consecutive visibility sections with the same visibility is useless and negatively
  impacts readability.
  Combining the sections into one larger section is more concise and easier to understand.
</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>
  This rule does <b>not</b> apply for visibility sections with only one <code>const</code> or
  <code>type</code> section, such as in the example below:
</p>
<pre>
type
  TFoo = class(TObject)
  private type
    TBar = Double;
    TBaz = Integer;
  private const
    CMyStr = 'abc';
  private
    FMyInt: Integer;
  end;
</pre>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Combine the consecutive visibility sections together:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
type
  TFoo = class(TObject)
  private
    FMyInt: Integer;
  private
    procedure Bar;
  end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
type
  TFoo = class(TObject)
  private
    FMyInt: Integer;
    procedure Bar;
  end;
</pre>
