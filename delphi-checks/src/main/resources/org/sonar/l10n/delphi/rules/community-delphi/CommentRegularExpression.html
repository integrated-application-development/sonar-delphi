<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  This rule template allows you to track the use of comments matching a given regular expression.
  Note that the regular expression must match the full text of the comment and will be executed
  in dotall mode (where the <code>.</code> character matches any character, including newlines).
</p>
<p>
  For example, one can create a rule with the regular expression <code>.*REVIEW.*</code>
  to match all comments containing "REVIEW". To match REVIEW regardless of the case, the
  <code>(?i)</code> modifier should be prepended to the expression: <code>(?i).*REVIEW.*</code>.
