<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Using an array index to compute the address of the first character in a string can lead to a range
  check error if range checking is enabled and the string is empty. When range checking is disabled,
  such an expression evaluates to <code>nil</code>. In all cases except that of empty strings with
  range checking enabled, casting to an <i>untyped</i> pointer type is equivalent.
</p>
<p>
  If a non-nil pointer is required, then the result of the cast can be checked and handled
  appropriately.
</p>
<p>
  This is especially relevant to interactions with the WinAPI, where strings are always passed by
  character pointer.
</p>

<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>
  Cast the string to <code>Pointer</code> to get the address of the first character without the
  possibility of a range check error.
