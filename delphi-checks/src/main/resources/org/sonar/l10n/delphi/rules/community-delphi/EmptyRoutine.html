<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Empty routines are usually superfluous, and should be removed to prevent unexpected behaviour.
  In some cases, however, empty routines are necessary. In these cases they should be accompanied
  by an explanatory comment in the body of the routine.
</p>
<p>This rule ignores the following, when annotated with a comment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Virtual methods (e.g. to provide a no-op default behaviour for child classes)</li>
  <li>Override methods (e.g. to not run behaviour implemented in ancestor classes)</li>
  <li>Methods that implement an interface</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>If the empty routine is an omission, remove it.</p>
<p>
  If the routine has a valid reason to be empty, add a nested comment explaining why the routine is
  blank:
</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure TExample.OverriddenMethod;
begin
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure TExample.OverriddenMethod;
begin
  // Overrides base class behaviour
end;
</pre>
