<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Casting a Character type (e.g. <code>Char</code>, <code>AnsiChar</code>) to a Character Pointer
  type (<code>PChar</code>, <code>PAnsiChar</code>) is non-portable between different versions of
  Delphi.
</p>
<p>
  Before Delphi 10.4, casting a character type to a character pointer type would take the ordinal
  value of the character and convert it to a pointer.
</p>
<p>
  In Delphi 10.4 and above, a new single-character string is constructed and the pointer to that
  string is returned instead.
</p>
<p>
  Because its behaviour is not consistent between Delphi versions, to maintain compatibility
  it should not be used.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>
  To consistently use the pre-Delphi 10.4 behaviour, convert the character to its ordinal value
  before casting.
</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure Example(MyChar: Char);
var
  MyPointer: PChar;
begin
  MyPointer := PChar(MyChar);
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure Example(MyChar: Char);
var
  MyPointer: PChar;
begin
  MyPointer := PChar(Ord(MyChar)); // Pointer containing the ordinal value of the character
end;
</pre>
<p>
  To consistently use the post-Delphi 10.4 behaviour, cast the character to a string type before
  casting to the character pointer type:
</p>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure Example(MyChar: Char);
var
  MyPointer: PChar;
begin
  MyPointer := PChar(MyChar);
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure Example(MyChar: Char);
var
  MyPointer: PChar;
begin
  MyPointer := PChar(String(MyChar)); // Pointer to a string containing the character
end;
</pre>
