<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Code should not be commented out as it bloats programs and reduces readability.
  Unused code should be deleted and can be retrieved from source control history if required.
</p>
<p>
  Please be mindful of the fact that certain comments, such as a single word followed by a
  semicolon, are indistinguishable from Delphi code and will be flagged.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
Remove the commented out code.
