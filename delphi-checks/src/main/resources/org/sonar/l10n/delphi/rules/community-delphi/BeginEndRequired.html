<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Code in which all blocks are fenced by <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> is simple and
  modular to understand. All blocks should use <code>begin</code>..<code>end</code>, except for
  <code>repeat</code> and <code>case</code> blocks.
</p>
<p>
  While most Delphi structures allow <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> to be omitted when
  there is only a single statement in the block, doing so often makes code more error-prone and
  difficult to read.
</p>
<p>
  Also, if another statement is added at a later stage and <code>begin</code> and
  <code>end</code> are not added, the new statement will be unexpectedly outside of the block.
  While the code below may seem correct at a glance, the <code>Exit</code> will always be
  encountered and <code>Foo.Bar</code> will never be run.
</p>
<pre>
if not Assigned(Foo) then
  Writeln('Foo not assigned!');
  Exit;

Foo.Bar;
</pre>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
Surround the statement with <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code>:
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
if not Assigned(MyObj) then
  Exit;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
if not Assigned(MyObj) then
begin
  Exit;
end;
</pre>
