<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  A method that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities. Such methods
  inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain.
</p>
<p>
  Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller methods which focus on
  well-defined tasks. Those smaller methods will not only be easier to understand, but also easier
  to test.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Refactor the large method into smaller methods, each focusing on a single well-defined task.</p>
