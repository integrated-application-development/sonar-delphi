<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Platform-dependent types have different sizes on different target platforms, while
  platform-independent types have the same size on all target platforms. Casts between
  platform-dependent and platform-independent types will have different behaviours on different
  target platforms, and should be removed.
</p>
<p>Platform-dependent types include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All pointer-based types, including strings, arrays, classes, and interfaces</li>
  <li><code>NativeInt</code> and <code>NativeUint</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>
  Refactor the code so that platform-dependent and platform-independent types are not cast
  to each other.
