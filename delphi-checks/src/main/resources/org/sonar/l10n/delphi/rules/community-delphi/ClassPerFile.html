<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Units with too many classes can be difficult to understand and maintain. Ideally, each
  class is self-contained and can be separated into separate units without loss of functionality.
</p>
<p>
  Nested classes or one-liner classes such as
  <code>ECustomException = class(Exception);</code> are not counted toward the limit.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>
  Group classes with related functionality into new units, and remove or merge unnecessary classes.
