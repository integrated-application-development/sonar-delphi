<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Code that follows a consistent naming convention is self-documenting. In Delphi, all variable
  names should be in PascalCase. This rule enforces that variables follow the following conventions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Variable names (both local and global) should be in PascalCase</li>
  <li>Global variable names should have a consistent prefix</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The required prefix for global variables defaults to <code>G</code>, although some projects may
  use another prefix to separate their global variables from those of other projects.
  This can make code spanning several projects more easily understandable.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Rename the variable name to follow the convention.</p>
