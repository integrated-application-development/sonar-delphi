<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Code that follows a consistent naming convention is self-documenting. In Delphi, all variable
  names should be in PascalCase. Global variables should have a consistent prefix.
</p>
<p>
  The default prefix for global variables is <code>G</code>, but some projects may use another
  prefix to separate their global variables from those of other projects. This can make code
  spanning several projects more easily understandable.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Rename the variable name to follow the convention.</p>
