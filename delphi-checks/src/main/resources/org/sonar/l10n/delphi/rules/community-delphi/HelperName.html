<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Code that follows a consistent naming convention is self-documenting. In Delphi, all class or
  record helper names should:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be in PascalCase</li>
  <li>Start with a consistent prefix</li>
  <li>Contain the name of the extended type</li>
  <li>End with <code>Helper</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  The default prefix is <code>T</code>, but some projects may use another prefix to separate their
  helpers from those of other projects. This can make code spanning several projects more easily
  understandable.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Rename the class or record helper to follow the convention.</p>
