<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Having unused methods adversely affects code readability, as their presence is confusing. Code
  that is never used should be removed to keep codebases clean and maintainable.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this rule excludes published methods, as these are often accessed via reflection or used
  by the Delphi IDE for design-time configuration. Methods marked as <code>override</code> and
  methods implementing an interface are also excluded.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the unused method.</p>
