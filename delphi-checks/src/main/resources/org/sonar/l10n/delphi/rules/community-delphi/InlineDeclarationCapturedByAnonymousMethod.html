<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Up until Delphi 10.4.2, there are compiler bugs related to inline variables captured by anonymous
  methods:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Inline variables will not have their lifetimes extended until the anonymous method goes out of
    scope. (Fixed in 10.4.1)
  </li>
  <li>
    Inline variables with managed types will not have their reference count updated when the
    anonymous method goes out of scope, causing memory leaks. (Fixed in 10.4.2)
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Use a traditional variable declaration instead of an an inline declaration:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure Example;
begin
  var MyObj := TFoo.Create as IFoo;

  TTask.Run(
    procedure begin
      Sleep(1000);
      MyObj.Bar;
    end
  );
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure Example;
var
  MyObj: IFoo;
begin
  MyObj := TFoo.Create;

  TTask.Run(
    procedure begin
      Sleep(1000);
      MyObj.Bar;
    end
  );
end;
</pre>
