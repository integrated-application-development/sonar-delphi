<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of <code>catch</code> blocks is to recover from what went wrong in the
  <code>try</code> block. If it's not known which error occurred, then it is difficult to know how
  to recover.
</p>
<p>
  This can lead to overly general error handling scenarios, like blindly displaying a
  "something went wrong" message.
</p>
<p>
  Catching all exceptions regardless of whether they are expected to be raised or not may also
  hide bugs. For example, a new bug raising an unexpected exception might introduced within the
  <code>try</code> block. A more specific catch block would not swallow this exception.
</p>
<p>
  Code that catches specific exceptions is also much clearer, aiding the long-term maintainability
  of your code.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Rewrite the exception handling block to catch specific exception types:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
try
  Contents := TFile.ReadAllText(FileName, TEncoding.UTF8);
except
  on E: Exception do begin
    Writeln('Could not read file');
  end;
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
try
  Contents := TFile.ReadAllText(FileName, TEncoding.UTF8);
except
  on E: EFileNotFoundException do begin
    Writeln('The file you have specified does not exist');
  end;
  on E: EEncodingError do begin
    Writeln('The file you have specified is not UTF-8 encoded');
  end;
end;
</pre>
