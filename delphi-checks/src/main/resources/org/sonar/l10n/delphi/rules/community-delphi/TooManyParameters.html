<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Long parameter lists are confusing to read, difficult to keep track of in the body of the method,
  and makes call sites inscrutable.
</p>
<p>
  A long parameter list indicates that a new structure should be created to wrap the numerous
  parameters, or that the method is doing too many things.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>
  Consider breaking this method up into multiple methods with a more narrow focus, or create a new
  class or record to encapsulate this method's configuration into fewer parameters.
