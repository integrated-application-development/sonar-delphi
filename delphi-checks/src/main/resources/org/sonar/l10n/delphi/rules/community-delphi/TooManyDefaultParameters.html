<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Though default parameters can be useful in cases when there is a sensible default value, they also damage API
  interfaces when used to make a method's behaviour overly configurable. A method with too many default parameters
  is confusing, unpredictable at a glance, unintuitive to use, and likely overloaded in functionality.
</p>
<p>
  In most cases, using method overloads, multiple methods, or configuration objects is a more
  appropriate solution.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>
  Refactor this routine by re-evaluating the need for the default values, and either:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removing the unnecessary default values,</li>
  <li>Adding multiple overloads with different groups of required parameters, or</li>
  <li>Grouping related parameters into a configuration object</li>
</ul>
