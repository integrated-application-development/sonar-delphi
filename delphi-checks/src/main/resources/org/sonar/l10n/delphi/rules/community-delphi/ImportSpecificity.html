<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  The interface uses clause should only contain imports that are required for the interface section.
  Imports that are only used in the implementation section should be moved there.
</p>
<p>
  Importing a unit in the interface section declares a compilation dependency on that unit.
  Units cannot have mutual (circular) dependencies in their interface sections, and a unit must be
  recompiled whenever a unit imported in its interface section is changed. Because of this,
  interface imports increase the time the compiler takes to resolve and validate dependencies.
</p>
<p>
  Implementation section imports do not have these limitations. If an import in the interface
  section doesn't need to be there, these costs are being incurred for no benefit.
</p>
<p>
  It also encapsulates implementation details where they belong - in the implementation section.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>
  Move the import into the implementation uses clause:
</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
unit Unit1;

interface

uses System.IOUtils;

procedure Run;

implementation

procedure Run;
begin
  TFile.WriteAllText('myfile.txt', 'Hello world');
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
unit Unit1;

interface

procedure Run;

implementation

uses System.IOUtils;

procedure Run;
begin
  TFile.WriteAllText('myfile.txt', 'Hello world');
end;
</pre>
