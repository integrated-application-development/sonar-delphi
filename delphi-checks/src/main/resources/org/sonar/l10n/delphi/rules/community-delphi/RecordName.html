<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Code that follows a consistent naming convention is self-documenting. In Delphi, all record names
  should be in PascalCase and be prefixed with a consistent prefix.
</p>
<p>
  The default prefix is <code>T</code>, but some projects may use another prefix to separate their
  records from those of other projects. This can make code spanning several projects more easily
  understandable.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Rename the record to follow the convention.</p>
