<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Having unused types adversely affects code readability, as their presence is confusing. Code
  that is never used should be removed to keep codebases clean and maintainable.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this rule excludes class and record helpers, as they augment another type and do not
  need to be directly referenced.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the unused type.</p>
