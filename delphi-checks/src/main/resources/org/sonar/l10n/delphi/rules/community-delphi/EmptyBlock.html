<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Most of the time a block of code is empty when a piece of code is really missing. An empty block
  should be either filled or removed.
</p>
<p>This rule excludes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Empty method bodies (covered by the <code>EmptyMethod</code> rule)</li>
  <li>Empty except blocks (covered by the <code>SwallowedException</code> rule)</li>
  <li>Case blocks that are empty apart from a comment</li>
</ul>
