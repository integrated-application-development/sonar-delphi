<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Empty methods are usually superfluous, and should be removed to prevent unexpected behaviour.</p>
<p>Some valid empty methods could include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A virtual method that is intended to be overridden</li>
  <li>An override method of a non-empty virtual method</li>
  <li>A method that exists only to implement an interface</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In these cases, a comment should be added to the method body to explain why the method is blank.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>If the empty method is an omission, remove it.</p>
<p>If the method should be empty, add a nested comment explaining why the method is blank:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure MyEmptyMethod;
begin
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure MyEmptyMethod;
begin
  // Empty because I really want it to be!
end;
</pre>
