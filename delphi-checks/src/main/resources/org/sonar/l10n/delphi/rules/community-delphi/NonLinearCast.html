<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Casting an object to a type that is not guaranteed to have the same memory configuration can
cause access violations if used improperly.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the improper cast by refactoring the code. If the intention is to provide additional
  methods to operate on an object, consider using a class helper instead.
