<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  This rule allows banning certain constants. It will flag any direct reference to a constant from
  the blacklist.
</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blacklisted constant names should be unqualified (e.g. <code>CMyConstant</code>).</li>
  <li>Only top-level constants are supported</li>
</ul>
