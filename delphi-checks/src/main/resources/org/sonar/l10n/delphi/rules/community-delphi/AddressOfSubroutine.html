<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Subroutines cannot be used as procedural values.
</p>
<p>
  This will normally cause a compilation error, but such errors can be bypassed by using the address
  of the subroutine with <code>@</code>.
</p>
<p>
  In this scenario, the code generated by compiler will have undefined behavior.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
Do not use <code>@</code> to get the address of a subroutine. If a method pointer is required,
convert the subroutine into a top-level method.
