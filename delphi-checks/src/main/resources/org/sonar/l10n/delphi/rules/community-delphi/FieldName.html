<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Code that follows a consistent naming convention is self-documenting. In Delphi, all field
  names should be in PascalCase and be prefixed with a consistent prefix.
</p>
<p>
  The default prefix is <code>F</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that published fields are exempt from this rule, as these are often generated.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Rename the field name to follow the convention.</p>
