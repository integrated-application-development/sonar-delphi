<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  The upper range of <code>for</code> loops is inclusive in Delphi, meaning that a typical
  zero-based collection iteration should start at 0 and end at one before the array length:
</p>
<pre>
for I := 0 to Length(Array) - 1 do
  WriteLn(Array[I]);
</pre>
<p>
  Forgetting to subtract one from the length of the collection is a common mistake in Delphi code,
  especially since in most other languages the convention is for the upper bound to be exclusive.
  If forgotten, this may cause access violations, buffer overruns, and other memory issues.
</p>
<p>
  When using non zero-based collections, the <code>Low</code> and <code>High</code> intrinsics
  should be used instead of iterating based on length.
</p>
<p>
  This rule catches suspicious cases of <code>System.Length</code> or <code>Count</code> properties
  being used as an upper bound. Iterations over strings are excluded as they are typically
  one-based.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>
  If the collection is zero-based, subtract one from the upper bound:
</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
for I := 0 to Length(Array) do
  WriteLn(Array[I]);
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
for I := 0 to Length(Array) - 1 do
  WriteLn(Array[I]);
</pre>
<p>
  If the collection is not zero-based, use the <code>Low</code> and <code>High</code> intrinsics
  to iterate instead:
</p>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
for I := 1 to Length(Array) do
  WriteLn(Array[I]);
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="compliant">
for I := Low(Array) to High(Array) do
  WriteLn(Array[I]);
</pre>
