<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how hard the control flow of a method is to understand.
  This can be caused by excessive use of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loop structures, like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code></li>
  <li>Conditionals, like <code>if</code>, <code>catch</code> and <code>case</code></li>
  <li>Recursive sequences</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Methods with high Cognitive Complexity will be difficult to maintain, as a very non-linear control
  flow is difficult to follow.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>
  Refactor the method to use less loops, conditionals, or recursion.
