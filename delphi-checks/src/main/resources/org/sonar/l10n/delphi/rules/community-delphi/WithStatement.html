<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  The <code>with</code> statement in Delphi, though seemingly clean and convenient, can introduce a
  host of issues that hinder code clarity and maintainability.
</p>
<p>
  It can lead to ambiguity and confusion. Identifiers within a <code>with</code> block may refer to
  local variables, members of the <code>Self</code> object, or members of the objects targeted by
  the <code>with</code> statement. This lack of clarity makes it harder to discern the origin and
  purpose of variables.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, <code>with</code> statements can potentially obscure variables declared in an outer
  scope, creating scope ambiguity and increasing the likelihood of unintended consequences.
</p>
<p>
  Worse still, the use of <code>with</code> can lead to surprising bugs, especially when an object
  within the <code>with</code> statement shares a member name with the <code>Self</code> object.
  Removing a class member can cause an overloaded <code>with</code> to select the other name,
  masking what would have been a compilation error if the field were accessed more explicitly.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the <code>with</code> statement and qualify any accesses within it:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure TMyForm.MyEvent(Sender: TObject);
begin
  with TButton.Create(Self) do begin
    Parent := Self;
    Left := 50;
    Top := 20;
    Caption := ClassName;
    Color := clRed;
  end;
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure TMyForm.MyEvent(Sender: TObject);
var
  MyButton: TButton;
begin
  MyButton := TButton.Create(Self);
  MyButton.Parent := Self;
  MyButton.Left := 50;
  MyButton.Top := 20;
  MyButton.Caption := ClassName;
  Self.Color := clRed;
end;
</pre>
