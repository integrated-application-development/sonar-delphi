<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  This rule allows banning certain methods. It will flag any direct reference to a method from the
  blacklist.
</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blacklisted method names should be fully qualified (e.g. <code>Unit.Type.Method</code>).</li>
  <li>Parameter signatures cannot be specified, so all overloads will be tracked.</li>
</ul>
