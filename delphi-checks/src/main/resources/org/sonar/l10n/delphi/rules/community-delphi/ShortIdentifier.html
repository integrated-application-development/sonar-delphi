<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  When an identifier is too short, it negatively impacts readability. To figure out the meaning of
  this meaningless variable name, all of the relevant code needs to be read and understood.
</p>
<p>
  This can be particularly frustrating in Delphi, as variable declarations may be fairly distant
  from its usage.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Use a longer and more explicit identifier name:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
var
  M: string;
begin
  M := LoadMessage;
  // ...
  Log(M);
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
var
  Message: string;
begin
  Message := LoadMessage;
  // ...
  Log(Message);
end;
</pre>
