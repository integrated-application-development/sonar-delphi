<p>Too many variables can indicate that a method is doing too many things.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Using many variables in a method can be an indicator that the method is doing too many things.

  A method should be a single logical task, not a number of disconnected tasks.
</p>
<p>
  Using a large number of redundant variables in a short span of code can also adversely affect
  readability.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Consider breaking the method up into multiple methods with different responsibilities:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure TMyObject.DoThing;
var
  MyFoo: TFoo;
  MyBar: TBar;
begin
  MyFoo := TFoo.Create;
  FMyFoo := MyFoo;

  MyBar := TBar.Create;
  FMyBar := MyBar;
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure TMyObject.DoFooThing;
var
  MyFoo: TFoo;
begin
  MyFoo := TFoo.Create;
  FMyFoo := MyFoo;
end;

procedure TMyObject.DoBarThing;
var
  MyFoo: TFoo;
begin
  MyBar := TBar.Create;
  FMyBar := MyBar;
end;
</pre>
<p>Another option is to inline unnecessarily verbose variables:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
procedure TMyObject.DoThing;
var
  MyFoo: TFoo;
  MyBar: TBar;
begin
  MyFoo := TFoo.Create;
  FMyFoo := MyFoo;

  MyBar := TBar.Create;
  FMyBar := MyBar;
end;
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="compliant">
procedure TMyObject.DoThing;
begin
  FMyFoo := TFoo.Create;
  FMyBar := TBar.Create;
end;
</pre>
