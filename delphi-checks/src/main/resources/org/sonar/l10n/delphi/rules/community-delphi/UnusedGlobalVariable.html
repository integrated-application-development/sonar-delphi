<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  Having unused global variables adversely affects code readability, as their presence is confusing.
  Code that is never used should be removed to keep codebases clean and maintainable.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this rule excludes the form variables automatically generated by the Delphi IDE using
  the following heuristic:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The variable declaration section is the last element in the interface section, and</li>
  <li>There is a single variable declaration in the variable declaration section, and</li>
  <li>The variable's type is a descendant of <code>TComponent</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the unused global variable.</p>
