# Contributing

Thank you for looking to contribute to SonarDelphi! GitHub issues and pull requests are the core
locations for community involvement.

## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs

Please report bugs via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/sonar-delphi/issues).

When reporting a bug, please do the following:

* Check that your issue has not already been reported
* Include the versions of SonarDelphi and SonarQube you are using
* Be as specific as possible in your description
* If applicable, supply a minimal case that replicates the issue

### Proposing features or improvements

Please propose new features on via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/sonar-delphi/issues).

When proposing a feature, please do the following:

* Check that a similar feature has not already been requested
* Be as specific as possible in your description

Note that this does not necessarily mean a developer will decide to fix the bug or implement the feature - if you would
like a feature, consider implementing it yourself and [making a pull request](#making-pull-requests).

### Contributing pull requests

[Pull requests](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/sonar-delphi/pulls) are welcome!

When making a pull request, please do the following:

* Ensure that the functionality is generally useful rather than specific to your use case
* For new features, ensure that it has been proposed and discussed in an issue prior to making the pull request
* Describe the contents of your pull request
* Clearly explain the rationale for adding it to SonarDelphi

Please note that SonarDelphi uses a rebase workflow, so PRs should have a clean and linear history.
